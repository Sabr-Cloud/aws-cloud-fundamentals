# Amazon EC2 (Elastic Cloud Compute)
## What EC2 is
EC2 is a virtual server in AWS that allows you to run applications, without owning physical hardware.
## Why EC2 is used
To host website and web apps
To run backend services
To replace on-premise (physical) servers
## Key Concepts
Instance types
AMI (Amazon Machine Image)
Key pairs
Security groups
## Real-World Example
A company hosts its website on an EC2 instance instead of buying a physical server
## What I learned
EC2 instances run inside a VPC
Security groups acts as virtual firewalls at the instance level
