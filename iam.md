# AWS IAM (Identity and Access Management).

## What IAM Is
IAM controls who can access AWS resources and what actions they can perform.
## Why IAM Is Used 
Manage users and permissions
Improve Security
Follow the principle of least privilege
## Key Concepts
Users
Groups
Roles
Policies
## Real-world Example
A developer in an organization is given access to EC2 but not billing information.
## what I Learned
Root account should not be used for daily tasks
Roles are preferred over access keys for EC2
